# Gamexpol Sp. z o.o.
Gamexpol is a small fictional company that sells dedicated game services, but its' on-premise infrastructure (now as code) is a bit outdated. The main task is to move that infra to year 2022 with containers and orchestrators instead of VMs where it's suitable. Can we do it? Aye!

There are three steps of this project:
1. Create on-premise infrastructure as code based on Virtual Machines
2. Move service by service to on-premise Kubernetes what's possible and cost-effective without overengineering too much
3. Move containerized infrastructure to cloud provider
